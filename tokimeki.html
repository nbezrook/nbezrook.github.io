I... was dumped numerous times by other boys.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thus, when I first arrived here, I decided to start over. I wanted to be famous in school, and I wanted all the boys to bow in front of me. Slowly but surely, the boys were starting to bow at my feet, then I gave them the cold shoulder as revenge against all the boys who treated me so bad before.&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER 1:</p><p>mar 14, 2003:&nbsp;<br />ugh i did it again&nbsp;<br />binged like a fatty -and things were going so good the whole week ... 600 cal&nbsp;<br /><br />yesturday my mum took a picture of me&nbsp;<br />when i looked at it, my collar bones looked so visible&nbsp;<br />-beautiful.&nbsp;<br />i was so happy ):</p><p>CHAPTER 2:</p><div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">abysses whose material and gravitational properties, and whose relation to his own entity, he could not even begin to explain. He did not walk or climb, fly or swim, crawl or wriggle; yet always experienced a mode of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary. Of his own condition he could not well judge, for sight of his arms, legs, and torso seemed always cut off by some odd disarrangement of perspective</div><p>CHAPTER 3:</p><div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">you are brought to life once again. you must be an important thread on the fates net to be beyond the deaths reach. i didnt change you. i have just only gave the form to the things you have always had nursed in your heart. you were not born as the beast, however, it has always been a part of you. nothing is happening by chance. i believe that youll finish your way happily, and you will find the things you are searching for from the first breath.</div><p>CHAPTER 4:</p><div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">You are a tiny little girl, Electra. Other little girls dreamed of being the richest or the most beautiful women of all. And you, fascinated by the horrid destiny of your people, you wished to become the most pained and the most criminal.</div><div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">&nbsp;</div><div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">CHAPTER 5:</div><div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">&nbsp;</div><div class="tralbumData tralbum-about"><div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">&ldquo;The painting showed a hairless, oppressed creature with a head like an inverted pear, its hands clapped in horror to its ears, its mouth open in a vast, soundless scream. Twisted ripples of the creatures torment, echoes of its cry, flooded out into the air surrounding it; the man or woman, whichever it was, had become contained by its own howl. It had covered its ears against its own sound. The creature stood on a bridge and no one else was present; the creature screamed in isolation. Cut off by - or despite - its outcry.&rdquo;</div></div><p>SMOGCAT04</p>', //The text to be written in the main part of the mini window (can contain HTML)
