Parents rehearsed scenes from reimagined &amp; reconstructed moments flickering on the screen, pity in their pursed lips for the creatures who now existed as the fiction of a past known only through memories inherited.</p><p style="text-align: center;">One of the exhibits tells of a future populated only with plastic &amp; chemical waste &ndash; out of nothing forms a bacterial civilization, inheritors of Earth more efficient than any machine&hellip; a lust for life that makes human history seem like the glimmer of a distant star, decaying by the time we sense its light.&rdquo;</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>-- Purportedly from Xiahou Songlian, <em>A Traveler&rsquo;s Diary</em>, date unknown.</p>', //The text to be written in the main part of the mini window (can contain HTML)
