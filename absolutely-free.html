Each wing of the building mapped itself to some biological community in which a collection of plants &amp; animals was thought to once exist. Red grass &amp; peaks of ice rendered using plastic &amp; foam formed islands of tundra, thick paper pines &amp; spruces dotted the carpeted landscapes of grassland &amp; taiga, and styrofoam canyons &amp; cliffs painted with orange &amp; brown loomed with dark shades over fields of dotted lines, named features, and pastel representations of flora &amp; fauna. The kids would read out the name of that once-great empire with slurred consonants, their voices bringing life to the static figurines who&rsquo;d in their years been sheltered by the fragments of a map so large &amp; detailed that it was as if that empire had never crumbled at all. All the parents &amp; guardians would fold their arms while the children rehearsed scenes from reimagined &amp; reconstructed moments flicking on the screen, a trace of pity in their pursed lips for the forgotten who now existed as the fiction of some distant past they knew only through memories inherited."<br /><br />all songs written &amp; produced by smoggycat&nbsp;<br /><br />tomo takino &amp; the absolutely free are:&nbsp;<br />smoggycat - vocals, acoustic guitars, electric guitar &amp; bass &amp; 12-string, alesis micron, korg microkorg, drums &amp; percussion &amp; bells &amp; chimes, soprano saxophone &amp; tuba &amp; bottleflutes, sampler &amp; mpc, arrangements&nbsp;<br />nick belida - saxophone, flute (2, 7, 8)&nbsp;<br />natalia d. cameroni - violin (2)&nbsp;<br />josh le - trombone (7)&nbsp;<br />joey di liberto - trumpet (7)&nbsp;<br />eddie a. mendoza - drunken banter (7)&nbsp;<br />martin renan chapman - 12 string guitar (2, 7)&nbsp;<br />karina sevilla - vocals (7)&nbsp;<br />ray stachowiak - drums (6)&nbsp;<br />the absolutely free orchestra - strings, brass, woodwinds (1,3,4,6,7,8,11)&nbsp;<br /><br />colin winegardner, adam abadilla, sanjay john - recording &amp; engineering (2,6,7)&nbsp;<br /><br />infinite love &amp; warmth to:&nbsp;<br />colin winegardner, adam abadilla, sanjay john, ray stachowiak, eddie a. mendoza, natalia d. cameroni, josh le, joey di liberto, nick belida, martin renan chapman, and karina sevilla for their time &amp; effort. good neighbor, globehead, the garage boys, everyone at ksdt, and ucsds coolest folk for their kind words &amp; support.&nbsp;<br /><br />a special "I &lt;3 U" to eric bracht for his help &amp; support.&nbsp;<br /><br />samples from "Raise The Red Lantern" by Zhao Jiping used on (4,6,11)&nbsp;<br />samples from "Bring It On" by Organized Konfusion used on (6)&nbsp;<br /><br />SMOGCAT08</p>', //The text to be written in the main part of the mini window (can contain HTML)
